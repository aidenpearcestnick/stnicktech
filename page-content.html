<p><b>What is MAP?</b> MAP is short for the Mayor's Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety. The purpose of MAP is to create safe, strong
neighborhoods through community and government joint problem-solving with the Role of increasing public safety. Addressing
crime in the MAP communities means investing in People through economic and social supports, investing in Places to promote
vibrant, well-maintained neighborhoods, and investing in Networks to ensure systems are fair and to strengthen resident and
government ability to work together and trust one another.</p>

<p><b>What is Neighborhood Stat?</b> Neighborhood Stat is an accountability mechanism that convened City agencies, local residents, and
community stakeholders on a routine basis to identify site-specific and citywide systems solutions to neighborhood public safety
concerns. Through Neighborhood State, community and government partners identify issues, establish priorities and implement
solutions in their neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>What is the MAP Stakeholder Team?</b> Under the facilitation of the MAP Engagement Coordinator, representatives from City agencies
and local community organizations will join residents to form a MAP Stakeholder Team. The Stakeholder Team will work together to
address local challenges by collecting data, identifying public safety concerns, creating action plans, and implementing collaborative
solutions. Each Team will include fifteen residents across age and gender and ten local representatives from MAP partners (including
NYCHA Property Managers, NCOS, and government outreach workers).</p>

<p><b>Who can join the Stakeholder Team?</b> All residents of a MAP development are eligible to complete an application. Ideal candidates
should be passionate about helping the community, solution-oriented, eager to learn new skills, and willing to engage and work well
with others in their development. The Stakeholder Team will set priority areas and will invite representatives from MAP partner
community-based organizations and City agencies whose work most directly overlaps with those priorities. Community-based
organizations and City agency representatives can email the MAP Engagement Coordinator for further information and other ways
to get involved.</p>

<p><b>What is the commitment?</b> MAP Stakeholder Team members will be asked to commit an average of 10 hours a month. During busy
seasons (such as the summer project implementation) we expect that members will be asked to volunteer additional hours. Each
month members will be asked to attend 3-4 activities, which may include meetings, trainings, public events, and/or community
benefit projects.</p>

<p><b>What is considered during the application process?</b> Stakeholder Team candidate selection will be based on many factors including,
but not limited to: skill sets, community networks and relationships, commitment to creative problem solving, passion for mission,
and team spirit. Candidates must attend an info session and submit a complete application. If you miss an info session please
contact the MAP Engagement Coordinator listed above.</p>

<p><b>Are there member incentives?</b> Members will receive a stipend and professional development training from experts around the city.</p>

<p><b>How long are member terms?</b> Member terms will end June 2019 unless otherwise terminated.</p>
